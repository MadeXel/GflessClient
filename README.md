## Instructions

1. Download and run the latest release installer.
2. Follow the installer prompts — it will create start menu entries and desktop shortcuts.
3. Generate your identity file (see instructions below).
4. Go to `Options > Settings` and select your identity file.
5. Go to `Options > Settings` and select your `NostaleClientX.exe`.
6. Add a Gameforge account.
7. Select the accounts you want to open and click **Play**.

## How to generate identity file

You need to extract a valid blackbox from a request to `auth/iovation`. The easiest way is to use `BlackboxExtractor.exe`, which is bundled in the installation directory:

1. The official Gameforge client can be running already — BlackboxExtractor will attach to it. If it's not running, BlackboxExtractor will launch it automatically.
2. Run `BlackboxExtractor.exe` from the installation folder (default: `C:\Program Files\Gfless Client`).
3. It will automatically launch the Gameforge client and capture the blackbox from the `auth/iovation` request.
4. The blackbox string is copied to your clipboard automatically. You should see it in the console output.
5. In GflessClient, go to `Options > Identity generator`, paste the blackbox, and click **Generate and save**.
6. Save the generated identity JSON file to a location of your choice.

> **Note:** If you prefer to capture the blackbox manually with Fiddler, you can still do so — but the bundled BlackboxExtractor is the recommended method.
